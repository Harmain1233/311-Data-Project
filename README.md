# NYC 311 Complaint Types Analysis (January 2023)

This project analyzes New York City's 311 service requests from January 2023 to identify trends in complaint types, peak hours, and resolution efficiency across boroughs. The analysis combines Python-based preprocessing with an interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate insights effectively.

**Key Insight:**  
Brooklyn had the highest volume of complaintsâ€”primarily illegal parking. Reports peaked between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, likely due to commuter congestion.

## Data Preparation Workflow

All cleaning and transformation steps were executed using `pandas` in Jupyter Notebook.  
Key preprocessing actions included:

1. Filtering the dataset for January 2023
2. Parsing datetime fields and calculating resolution time (in days)
3. Dropping records with missing borough or date values
4. Removing unnecessary columns (`latitude`, `longitude`)
5. Rounding resolution time for readability
6. Saving the cleaned data for Tableau use
